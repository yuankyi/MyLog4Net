	/// <remarks>
	/// <para>
	/// This Appender is designed to deliver events to a remote sink. 
	/// That is any object that implements the <see cref="T:log4net.Appender.RemotingAppender.IRemoteLoggingSink" />
	/// interface. It delivers the events using .NET remoting. The
	/// object to deliver events to is specified by setting the
	/// appenders <see cref="P:log4net.Appender.RemotingAppender.Sink" /> property.</para>
	/// <para>
	/// The RemotingAppender buffers events before sending them. This allows it to 
	/// make more efficient use of the remoting infrastructure.</para>
	/// <para>
	/// Once the buffer is full the events are still not sent immediately. 
	/// They are scheduled to be sent using a pool thread. The effect is that 
	/// the send occurs asynchronously. This is very important for a 
	/// number of non obvious reasons. The remoting infrastructure will 
	/// flow thread local variables (stored in the <see cref="T:System.Runtime.Remoting.Messaging.CallContext" />),
	/// if they are marked as <see cref="T:System.Runtime.Remoting.Messaging.ILogicalThreadAffinative" />, across the 
	/// remoting boundary. If the server is not contactable then
	/// the remoting infrastructure will clear the <see cref="T:System.Runtime.Remoting.Messaging.ILogicalThreadAffinative" />
	/// objects from the <see cref="T:System.Runtime.Remoting.Messaging.CallContext" />. To prevent a logging failure from
	/// having side effects on the calling application the remoting call must be made
	/// from a separate thread to the one used by the application. A <see cref="T:System.Threading.ThreadPool" />
	/// thread is used for this. If no <see cref="T:System.Threading.ThreadPool" /> thread is available then
	/// the events will block in the thread pool manager until a thread is available.</para>
	/// <para>
	/// Because the events are sent asynchronously using pool threads it is possible to close 
	/// this appender before all the queued events have been sent.
	/// When closing the appender attempts to wait until all the queued events have been sent, but 
	/// this will timeout after 30 seconds regardless.</para>
	/// <para>
	/// If this appender is being closed because the <see cref="E:System.AppDomain.ProcessExit" />
	/// event has fired it may not be possible to send all the queued events. During process
	/// exit the runtime limits the time that a <see cref="E:System.AppDomain.ProcessExit" />
	/// event handler is allowed to run for. If the runtime terminates the threads before
	/// the queued events have been sent then they will be lost. To ensure that all events
	/// are sent the appender must be closed before the application exits. See 
	/// <see cref="M:log4net.Core.LoggerManager.Shutdown" /> for details on how to shutdown
	/// log4net programmatically.</para>
