	/// <c>ReaderWriterLock</c> is used to synchronize access to a resource. 
	/// At any given time, it allows either concurrent read access for 
	/// multiple threads, or write access for a single thread. In a 
	/// situation where a resource is changed infrequently, a 
	/// <c>ReaderWriterLock</c> provides better throughput than a simple 
	/// one-at-a-time lock, such as <see cref="T:System.Threading.Monitor" />.

	/// <para>
	/// If a platform does not support a <c>System.Threading.ReaderWriterLock</c> 
	/// implementation then all readers and writers are serialized. Therefore 
	/// the caller must not rely on multiple simultaneous readers.
